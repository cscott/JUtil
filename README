This directory contains java sources for the JUtil java utility classes.

If you've grabbed the sources from CVS, you'll want to run ./autogen.sh
to let autoheader/autoconf/automake do their thing.  This is not necessary
if you're using a release distributed as a .tar.gz file.

A Java 1.5 compiler is required.

See the INSTALL file for generic build instructions;
the BUILDING file has more specific information.
