Version 1.1 - January 2004, by C. Scott Ananian

Interfaces have been changed to match the genericized-with-wildcards
signatures of the standard library collection classes.

Version 1.3 - October 2006, by C. Scott Ananian

Repackaged to build with ant and/or eclipse.  Several factories updated to
take advantage of new classes introduced in Java 1.5 (for example, EnumSet).
Several new classes (PersistentMap/Set/MultiMap, etc).  CollectionWrapper
classes made abstract, with a virtual 'wrapped()' method to allow greater type
safety.  UnmodifiableMultiMap wrapper made safe.
